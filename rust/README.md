# Rust player

The port implements all eight scenes, played in the original order (parts 1, 2,
6, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8), plus the STMIK sequencer and stereo sample mixer. It reads
the original assets and the unpacked programs' data tables but never executes
DOS code. You generate that data yourself from your own `PANIC.EXE`; none of it
is included here.

[NOTICE](NOTICE).

## Setup

You need Rust 1.88 or newer. The desktop build compiles SDL2 0.38.0 from
bundled source, so it also needs CMake and a C/C++ compiler. On Linux, install
the development packages SDL needs for your display and audio system. The
headless build is pure Rust and needs neither SDL nor CMake.

The importer needs Python, Unicorn 2.1.4, Capstone 5.0.7 and Deark. It was
tested with Deark 1.7.3-1, revision
`8997059c4f32af79978fb6c83be7c1c26c259afa`. To build that revision and import
your data, run this from the repository root (you'll need Git, make and a C
compiler):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jsummers/deark.git artifacts/tools/deark
git -C artifacts/tools/deark checkout 8997059c4f32af79978fb6c83be7c1c26c259afa
make -C artifacts/tools/deark
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-import.txt
.venv/bin/python tools/import_panic.py /path/to/PANIC.EXE \
  --deark artifacts/tools/deark/deark --out artifacts/local-data
```

On Windows, use `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` and a Windows build of Deark.
Everything under `artifacts/` is ignored by Git.

Your `PANIC.EXE` must have SHA-256
`a7ceeae290a7132880cd6ba616c2b0bb4001b2f7c83694f04052314fa26df6e7`.
The importer checks the hash of every file it produces before finishing, and
copies the demo's own notice to `files/README.TXT`. The output includes
original program code, so keep it out of Git. Importing it doesn't give you any
extra rights to use or share it.

## Run

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -- --data artifacts/local-data
cargo run --release --locked --no-default-features -- \
  --headless --data artifacts/local-data
```

Escape quits, Space pauses and F toggles fullscreen. Useful options:

- `--seek 180` fast-forwards to the three-minute mark before playing.
- `--mute` silences the audio but keeps the music driving scene timing.
- `--fallback` uses the original no-music scene schedules.
- `--seconds 10` stops after ten seconds.
- `--out artifacts/export` saves output there. In headless mode that's a WAV,
  a snapshot every ten seconds and a timeline CSV; the desktop player saves a
  screenshot of each scene and a run summary.
- `--fullscreen` starts in fullscreen.

Instead of `--data` you can set `PANIC_DATA`. With neither, the player looks
for a `data/` directory in the current directory or next to the executable.
The output of `panic_resources.py extract` isn't enough to run the player; use
the full importer.

## Tests

The normal suite needs no original files:

```sh
cargo test --release --locked --no-default-features
```

Tests that compare against original data or recorded reference output are
marked `#[ignore]`. They read their inputs at run time rather than embedding
them. To run them, point `PANIC_DATA` at your imported data and
`PANIC_FIXTURES` at a directory containing `tests/fixtures/` and
`testdata/567/` reference files:

```sh
PANIC_DATA=/path/to/imported-data PANIC_FIXTURES=/path/to/reference-rust \
  cargo test --release --locked --no-default-features -- --ignored
```

The importer doesn't create those reference files, and they aren't distributed
here. Don't commit any binary fixtures, including audio.

## Timing and platform notes

The player runs on a fixed 70 Hz scene timer with 16 kHz stereo audio mixed in
512-byte blocks. Scene arithmetic and sequencing follow the original, but real
VGA and PIT timing isn't emulated, so frame timing won't match every DOS
machine exactly. A full headless run takes 17,442 timer steps (249.171429
seconds).

It's been tested on Apple Silicon Macs. It should build elsewhere, but display
and audio on other platforms haven't been checked yet.
